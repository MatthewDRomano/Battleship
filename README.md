## Description
I began working on this game on February 8, 2023. This is my first big project in Java Swing and my first big project in Java all together. The visual design of this game along with the ships is inspired by Mass Effect, so it is not a direct copy of the original battleship game. I do plan on continuing to improve this game and pushing updates fairly regularly as it is not yet complete. As of right now, this game is singleplayer only with randomly generated enemy moves, but I plan on incorporating multiplayer soon.
